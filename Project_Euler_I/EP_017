solved using paper
determined number of occurences of each unique root word
multiplied occurences by number of letters in each root word
summed the resulting products to get final result

ex: one is a root word that shows up 191 times from 1 - 1000
    twelve is a root word that shows up 10 times from 1 - 1000
below is a list of all root words of the numbers 1 - 1000:

one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 
ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen,
twenty, thirty, fourty, fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety,
hundred,
"and", 
thousand

this can be simplified further by splitting nunmbers like sixteen into "six" and "teen" but this is not necessary
